# Asset and data sources

## Real consultation and strategy photographs

The strategy steps and FAQ use photographer-created stock photographs, not AI-generated pictures. Step 3 retains the user's original house photograph. All new photographs were downloaded from Pexels on 2026-09-25 as compressed 1600-pixel-wide JPEGs. Their content is unchanged; framing and overlays use CSS.

## Strategy section property video

- Matching poster: `public/images/strategy-property-video-poster.jpg`.
- Source: [European style buildings, Mixkit 4352](https://mixkit.co/free-stock-video/european-style-buildings-4352/).
- Video download: https://assets.mixkit.co/videos/4352/4352-720.mp4

- License: [Mixkit Stock Video Free License](https://mixkit.co/license/), commercial and personal website use permitted by the individual source page; checked 2026-09-25.
- Authentic stock footage of Paris apartment buildings, used illustratively. These are not represented as actual Investo listings or a German location.
- Files are hosted locally and copied unchanged. The video loops silently while the section is visible, pauses offscreen, and offers translated play/pause controls. Reduced-motion users initially see the matching still poster and can start playback manually. Mobile framing is square, with the desktop video fitting beside the strategy steps.

## User-supplied house photographs

Four original JPG attachments supplied by the user on 2026-09-24 replace the repeated property image. Files are copied unchanged; framing uses CSS object positioning.

- `public/images/house-blue-porch.jpg` — attachment 3; hero property showcase.
- `public/images/house-garden-dusk.jpg` — attachment 1; property-matching step in the Strategy Check section.
- `public/images/house-warm-evening.jpg` — attachment 2; former FAQ image, retained but no longer displayed.
- `public/images/house-turquoise-terrace.jpg` — attachment 4; former closing strategy image, retained but no longer displayed.

Descriptive alt text is available in German, English and French. These are illustrative photographs; their locations are not asserted.

Investo Immobilien UG; managing director Alpaslan Coskun; Maximilianstraße 15c, 87719 Mindelheim; +49 (0) 175 7111 188; info@investo-immobilien.de; HRB 22308, Amtsgericht Memmingen; VAT ID DE463921337.

Existing unrelated remote assets and the existing founder video are retained from the supplied source.


## Responsive media and local fonts (September 2026)

The WebP files in public/images/optimized are resized and compressed versions of the existing supplied or credited photographs and logos. No new AI images were introduced. src/content/image-manifest.json retains the original URL/path mapping.

Inter and Lora are now served locally. Font source URLs and the bundled SIL Open Font License files are in public/fonts/SOURCES.md.

The hero derivative is cropped to the displayed 4:3 framing (45% vertical focus); CSS adapts it to the desktop frame. The faint villa-background derivative has its existing grayscale effect encoded into the image to avoid a large runtime filter. Original photographs remain available.
